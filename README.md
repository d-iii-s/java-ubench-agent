Microbenchmarking Agent for Java
================================

A JVMTI agent to be used with microbenchmarks. Basic features:

- Reports major JVM events such as GC and JIT runs.
- Can collect performance counters through JNI.
- Can collect accurate time through JNI.

Usage
-----
```java
private static final int LOOPS = 10;
private static final String[] EVENTS = {
	/* The most precise clock available. */
	"SYS:wallclock-time",
	/* Number of JIT compilation events. */
	"JVM:compilations",
	/* L1 cache misses (only Linux with PAPI). */
	"PAPI:PAPI_L1_DCM"
};

public static void myBenchmark() {
	/*
	 * We would have LOOPS measurements and we want to record these EVENTS.
	 *
	 * But we limit ourselves to supported events (i.e. in this case it
	 * would remove PAPI:PAPI_L1_DCM event if libpapi would not be available
	 * on the system.
	 */
	Benchmark.init(LOOPS, Measurement.filterSupportedEvents(EVENTS));

	for (int i = 0; i < LOOPS; i++) {
		/* Start the measurement. */
		Benchmark.start();

		/* Here goes your code that ought to be measured. */

		/* Stop the measurement. */
		Benchmark.stop();
	}

	/* Get the results (available as Iterable<long[]>). */
	BenchmarkResults results = Benchmark.getResults();

	/* Either print them in CSV (to be later processed)... */
	BenchmarkResultsPrinter.toCsv(results, System.out);

	/* ... or as a space-padded table. */
	BenchmarkResultsPrinter.table(results, System.out);
}
```

To run your program with our agent, add the `ubench-agent.jar` to
your classpath and start JVM with the C-agent:
`-agentpath:libubench-agent.so` (GNU/Linux)
or `-agentpath:ubench-agent.dll` (Windows).

A more generic interface `Measurement` is available if you wish to
bind the measurement to a specific thread or if you need to measure
more things at once (though internal limitations of Linux perf
subsystem may apply).

Compilation
-----------
You will need recent version of Ant and GCC. Then simple
```
ant && ant test test-junit
```
shall compile the agent and run the built-in tests
(you might need to set `JAVA_HOME` if you have JDK in non-standard location).

You might also wish to execute
```
ant lib
```
to create a JAR with the agent class files (it also copies the C-agent to
the same folder for easier use).

Demo
----
Package `cz.cuni.mff.d3s.perf.demo` contains a small demo: the `MeasureHashing`
class measures performance of a file hashing with Java built-in MD5.
Run it with
```
ant demo
```
to produce results that could look like this:
```

Supported events
----------------

To list supported events, run the `ListEvents` demo program or execute
`ant list-events`.

* `SYS:wallclock-time`
  * The most precise clock available.
    `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` on Linux,
    `QueryPerformanceCounter()` on Windows.
* `SYS:thread-time`
  * CPU thread time (i.e. not counting when thread is waiting).
* `SYS:thread-time-rusage`
  * Same as `SYS:thread-time` but uses data from `getrusage()` call on Linux.
    Seems to be much less precise but it may save you one extra call if you
    also query `SYS:forced-context-switches`. Linux only.
* `SYS:forced-context-switches`
  * Number of forced context switches (i.e. quantum was exhausted).
    Linux only.
* `JVM:compilations`
  * Number of JIT compilation events.
* `PAPI:*`
  * When built on Linux with libpapi available, the agent can collect any
    event supported by PAPI (note that you can use all the events reported
    by `papi_avail` and `papi_native_avail`).
  * Note that to use different components (e.g. `perf` and `rapl`), different
    event sets has to be created.
